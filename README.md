## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Practicing mobile first development and focusing on low css specificity for a good readability and maintainability.

**mix-blend-mode technique üëçüòé**  
The image color is controled with the picture element and the css rule `mix-blend-mode`. I set a background color on the picture element and the `mix-blend-mode:multiply` on the `<img>` element. This is a very interesting and simple way to handle this type of component instead of adding an absolute positioned overlay.

**word highlight in the title üí°**  
I had a concern about the highlighted word in the title regarding accessibility as it ads verbosity when testing with voice over. The title is split in 3 parts : [1. before the highlighted word] [2. the highlighted word] [3. after the highlighted word].  
I learned that it's not an important accessible issue as it's related to the screen reader verbosity settings.
